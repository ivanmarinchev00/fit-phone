# Fitphone
- # **1. Empathize**

The quotes of our personas “The best way to prevent smartphone overuse is to try and keep your phone out of sight” and “The best way to minimize phone usage is to develop hobbies that feed your soul” let us think that they want to restrict the usage of their smartphones because they spend 4-8 hours using them. Most of their time is spent on social media like Instagram, Whatsapp.  Both of the personas want to be fit and live a healthy life. One of them uses an IPhone and the other one uses Android. The girl is more active in the afternoon but the boy in the evening.

- # **2. Define**

Given the personas, we analyzed their goals and needs and thought of an interesting proposition. While both personas are motivated and young people, they have one negative trait in common - high use of their smartphones. Researchers link high phone use to various health issues such as anxiety, sleep deprivation, cancer and depression to just name a few. Many people probably don’t even realize the damage they are causing themselves by spending so much time on their phone screens. That is why we’re creating an app that spreads awareness on phone use. 


- # **3. Ideation**

During the Ideate phase, we brainstormed and noted down multiple ideas. Some of them were already existing on the market, so we decided to come up with something creative.
Some of the ideas were:

- Sleep Diary

- Phone alert notifications regarding phone usage

- Work schedule

- Goal Tracker

- Challenges App

The idea that we choose to be our concept is :
FitPhone - an application that is based on two main features, Challenge Me -  encourages the user to be more productive and by completing the challenges he is rewarded, Teach Me- gives the user the possibility to learn more about selected topics and the extra features that can be found in the app refer to displaying motivational quotes and information about the progress that the user has.

- # **4. Prototyping**
